## Future
  I have little knowlage about Tech,  
  So I am learning about Tech.  
  I often see Github, but I have never written it.  
  Using Github's service to master this Git's Web service and to become read and write English sentences.  
  This is a set piece of goal.  
  I plan to update this Repository  about something almost every day even though it is slight.  
  

## 2019/3/13 now
  I could't continue update... this Repository from the first update day. 
  I must be need reconsideration.
